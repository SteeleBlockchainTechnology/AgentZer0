# AgentZer0Final

A Python-based AI agent that uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to perform web automation and research tasks. The agent leverages LangChain and OpenAI's language models to execute complex tasks like searching for cryptocurrency prices online.

## Features

- **MCP Integration**: Uses Model Context Protocol for modular tool integration
- **Web Automation**: Integrated with Playwright for browser automation tasks
- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes OpenAI-compatible language models via OpenRouter
- **Async Architecture**: Built with asyncio for efficient concurrent operations
- **Configurable**: Easy configuration through JSON files

## Architecture

The project consists of several key components:

- `main.py`: Main application entry point and agent orchestration
- `mcp_client.py`: MCP client implementation (currently empty, ready for custom extensions)
- `config/mcp_servers.json`: Configuration for MCP servers and tools
- `pyproject.toml`: Poetry project configuration and dependencies

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

- **mcp-use[search]**: Model Context Protocol client with search capabilities
- **langchain[openai]**: LangChain framework with OpenAI integration
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **playwright**: Web automation (via MCP server)

### Python Version

- Requires Python 3.13+

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AgentZer0Final
   ```

2. **Install Poetry** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Install Playwright** (for web automation):
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Configuration

### MCP Servers

The agent is configured to use Playwright for web automation. The configuration is stored in `config/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "DISPLAY": ":1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Language Model

The agent is configured to use Mistral Small 3.1 24B via OpenRouter. You can modify the model in `main.py`:

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free",
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY"),
    openai_api_base="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    temperature=0.7,
)
```

## Usage

### Running the Agent

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

### Example Tasks

The current implementation demonstrates searching for Bitcoin prices:

```python
result = await agent.run(
    "search online for current price of btc.",
)
```

### Customizing Tasks

You can modify the task in `main.py` by changing the prompt passed to `agent.run()`:

```python
result = await agent.run(
    "Your custom task here",
)
```

## Development

### Project Structure

```

### Adding New Capabilities

1. **New MCP Servers**: Add server configurations to `config/mcp_servers.json`
2. **Custom Tools**: Implement custom functionality in `mcp_client.py`
3. **New Tasks**: Modify the agent prompts in `main.py`

### Agent Configuration

The agent is configured with:

- **Max Steps**: 30 (maximum reasoning/action steps)
- **Server Manager**: Enabled for automatic MCP server management
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (creativity vs consistency balance)

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key for accessing language models
- `DISPLAY`: X11 display for Playwright (Linux/WSL environments)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing API Key**: Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
2. **Playwright Issues**: Run `npx playwright install` to install browser dependencies
3. **Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.13 or higher
4. **Display Issues**: Set `DISPLAY=:1` in your environment for headless operation

### Getting Help

For issues and questions:

- Check the error logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify your API key has sufficient credits
- Check that Playwright browsers are installed

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for development:

- Discord bot integration
- Additional MCP server integrations
- Custom tool development
- Task scheduling and automation
- Result persistence and logging
